This is a C++ program that uses a vector to store high scores for a game, and sorts them based on score.

The program defines a struct Highscore that contains a name field and a score field. It then defines functions readData, sortData, displayData, and indexOfLargest to read in high scores, sort them, display them, and find the index of the largest score respectively.

In the main function, the user is prompted for the number of scores they wish to enter. The program then creates a vector of Highscore structs with that size and passes it to readData to fill in the names and scores. sortData is then called to sort the vector, and displayData is called to display the sorted high scores.

The program uses iterators to traverse the vector and access the name and score fields of each Highscore struct. It also uses the swap function from the <algorithm> library to swap elements in the vector during sorting.
